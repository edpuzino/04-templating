#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Ed Puzino and Kevin O'Halloran paired together. It took about 5 hours total.**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on adding the handlebars js file via cdn.
  2. Next, added the handlebars template script to the index.html head, and adding extra data-attributes to the template. Note that we needed to put the handlebars variables in quotes when they were used inside a tag; otherwise a two word value would get split -- only the first word would be treated as a value, and the second would be treated as a new attribute.
  3. Using live-server, we could check and see that the handlbars template was rendering the filter lists and the articles. 
  4. We refactored several event handler functions into arrow function syntax.
